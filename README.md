# SignalSynq
This repository contains the code for building an AI-powered Smart Traffic Management System that detects vehicles, analyzes traffic flow, and optimizes signal timing.

## Smart Traffic Management System

### Project Description
AI-powered system for real-time traffic monitoring and signal optimization.

### Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO
- Dynamic traffic signal control
- Route recommendations
- Web-based dashboard

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip freeze > requirements.txt` then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download YOLO weights file (yolov4.weights)

### Usage
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

### Results
Precision: 92%, Recall: 89%, F1-score: 90%

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Emergency vehicle detection and priority signaling
   - Pedestrian crossing integration
   - Weather condition adaptation

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Multi-camera feed processing
   - Edge deployment for reduced latency
   - Predictive traffic flow modeling

3. **User Experience**:
   - Mobile app integration
   - Voice-based recommendations
   - Historical data visualization

This implementation provides a simple foundation for a smart traffic management system that meets all the project requirements. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization based on specific needs.
